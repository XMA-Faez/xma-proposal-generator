# XMA Agency Proposal Generator Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for setting up, maintaining, and extending the XMA Proposal Generator application. This internal tool enables team members to create professional marketing proposals with customized packages, services, and pricing for clients.

## Project Setup

### Environment Requirements

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm, yarn, or bun
- Supabase project with authentication enabled

### Environment Variables

Create an `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
# Supabase connection details
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key

# Application URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
# For local development:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository from the company's Git repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   bun install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```
4. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

### Creating an Admin User

To create an initial admin user, use the provided script:

```bash
npm run seed:admin admin@xmaagency.com your-secure-password
```

This will create a user with admin privileges that can access the system.

## Key Features Explained

### Order ID Generation

The system automatically generates structured order IDs (e.g., XMA-2025-04-00001):

```javascript
// lib/orderIdGenerator.ts
export function generateOrderId(sequentialNumber: number): string {
  const now = new Date();
  const year = now.getFullYear();
  const month = String(now.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, "0");
  const sequence = String(sequentialNumber).padStart(5, "0");

  return `XMA-${year}-${month}-${sequence}`;
}
```

This creates a consistent format with:
- Company prefix (XMA)
- Year (e.g., 2025)
- Month (e.g., 04 for April)
- Sequential number (e.g., 00001)

### Proposal Data Storage

Each proposal is stored with two approaches:
1. **Relational data**: Key information stored in normalized tables for filtering and reporting
2. **JSON snapshot**: Complete proposal data stored as JSON for rendering

This dual approach ensures:
- Fast queries for listings and filters
- Complete data preservation regardless of future schema changes
- Reliable rendering of historical proposals

### Discount System

The application supports a sophisticated discount system:
- **Package discounts**: Applied to the selected package
- **Service discounts**: Applied individually to services
- **Overall discounts**: Applied to the entire proposal

Each discount can be:
- **Percentage-based**: e.g., 10% off
- **Fixed amount**: e.g., 500 AED off

### Authentication and Authorization

The application uses Supabase Auth with custom profile roles:
- **Admin**: Can create and manage proposals
- **Guest**: Can view shared proposals via tokens

RLS (Row Level Security) policies in Supabase ensure proper data access.

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Packages

1. Go to the Supabase Dashboard > Table Editor > `packages`
2. Click "Insert row" and fill in the details:
   - Name (e.g., "Enterprise")
   - Price
   - Currency (default "AED")
   - USD Price (for reference)
   - Description
   - Toggle "is_popular" if it should be highlighted

3. Then go to `package_features` to add features:
   - Select the newly created package ID
   - Add feature text
   - Set whether it's bold, included
   - Set the display order (1, 2, 3, etc.)

### Adding New Services

1. Go to the Supabase Dashboard > Table Editor > `services`
2. Click "Insert row" and fill in the details:
   - Name
   - Price
   - Currency
   - Description
   - Toggle "is_monthly" if it has recurring fees
   - Setup fee (if applicable)

### Modifying the User Interface

Most UI components are in the `/components` directory:

- For proposal page layout: Edit components in `/components/proposal/`
- For admin interfaces: Edit components in `/components/admin/`
- For shared UI elements: Edit components in `/components/ui/`

### Adding an Admin User

1. First create a user in Supabase Auth (or have them sign up)
2. Then use the admin script to assign admin role:

```bash
npm run seed:admin user@example.com password
```

Or manually in Supabase:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Table Editor > `profiles`
2. Find the user by ID or email
3. Set their `role` column to "admin"

## Deployment

### Production Setup

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

For continuous deployment, set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or similar.

### Environment Configuration

For production, ensure these environment variables are set:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` (set to the production URL)

## Maintenance

### Regular Database Backups

Schedule regular backups of your Supabase database:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Project Settings > Database
2. Under "Database Backups", click "Create manual backup"
3. Download and store securely

### Dependency Updates

Periodically update dependencies for security and features:

```bash
npm outdated
npm update
```

Review package.json after updates and test thoroughly.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

- Check Supabase logs for auth failures
- Verify environment variables are correctly set
- Ensure user roles are properly assigned in profiles table

### Proposal Generation Issues

- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify Supabase connection is working
- Ensure packages and services exist in the database

### Missing Components or Styles

- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check that CSS files are being loaded correctly
- Clear browser cache or try in incognito mode
